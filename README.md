# Welcome

Thanks for checking out, and hopefully using, my Gatsby website starter with CSS Grid and styled-component support. I actively update this for my own use so feel free to grab a copy whenever you like to preserve it.

I have kept the original Gatsby `hello-world` `README` (as `GATSBY_README.md`) for reference.

## Installation

Use the `gatsby cli` to install

```
gatsby new [site-name] https://githublink
```

## Implementation

To import styled components include the import in each .js page:

```
import styled from 'styled-components'
```

The `Grid`, `Layout` and `Theme` components can be found in:

```
src/layout/*.js
```

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.
